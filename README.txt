Data Set Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00294/
I'm using the table Folds5x2_pp.xlsx of sheet 5
dataSets.csv contains the data sets
this Training Results.xlsx contains the Report of the training accuracy and the Report of the test accuracy
After tune the result, I found Epochs = 100 and Learning Rate = 0.0005 have the most observable MSE difference between each iteration
I also attached it to the zip file
Summarize
The result is good. I like my result.
I learned how the BACKPROPAGATION works and implemented it to my neural network function.
There are 3 activate functions in this program.
I prefer the Relu function, because it's easier to implement.
But on the reslut, Relu isn't the the best solution for this data set. The sigmoid got the most small MSE on both Train data and Test data.
